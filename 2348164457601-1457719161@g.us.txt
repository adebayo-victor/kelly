Raquel: *THERE ARE ENCOUNTERS WITH GOD THAT DO NOT JUST BLESS A MAN… THEY TRANSFORM HIS LIFE COMPLETELY.*

Every time we gather in His presence, we step into an atmosphere where burdens are lifted, hearts are strengthened, and lives are renewed by the power of Jesus Christ.

Join us this Sunday for a powerful time of prayer, worship, the Word, and Communion as we seek the Lord together and receive from Him.

*Special Healing & Monthly Communion Service*

🗓 Sunday, 8th February 2026

Come expectant.  
Come believing.

We look forward to fellowshipping with you.🌹
